Trigger for phrases like "analyse this sprint", "what does the burndown say", "how is the sprint looking", "write up the sprint report", or "what should I tell the team today".

- Carryover trend

## Flow
- Too much work in progress

- Blocked tickets
- Aging tickets

## Quality
- Bugs created
- Reopened bugs
- Delayed testing

## Team Capacity

# FINAL ACTION (MANDATORY)

After generating the report, ask the user where they want it saved:

> "Where would you like me to save this? I can save it locally or push it directly to any platform you have connected via MCP."
>
> **Local**
> 1. **Local file** — saved to `clients/CLIENT/sprint-artefacts/YYYY-MM-DD-sprint-N-report.md`
>
> **Connected platforms (via MCP)**
> 2. **Confluence** — published as a new page (I'll ask for your domain, space, and parent page)
> 3. **Google Drive** — saved as a new Doc (I'll ask for the folder)
> 4. **Notion** — created as a new page (I'll ask for your workspace and parent page)
>
> **No save**
> 5. **Clipboard only** — leave it here for you to copy manually

Do not save or publish anything until the user confirms the destination.

**If Confluence is chosen:**
1. Ask for the Confluence cloud domain, space key, and parent page title or ID
2. Resolve the space ID using `getConfluenceSpaces` if needed
3. Use `createConfluencePage` with:
   - `cloudId`: as provided by the user
   - `spaceId`: resolved from the space key
   - `parentId`: as provided by the user
   - `title`: `{Project} Sprint Report — {Sprint Name}, Day {N} ({YYYY-MM-DD})`
   - `contentFormat`: `markdown`
   - `body`: the full report markdown
4. Return the live Confluence page URL to the user
